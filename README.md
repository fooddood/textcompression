# textcompression
The program is written in python 3.4

It needs to be in a folder with .txt files named 'sample_text', 'compressed', and 'decompressed'

sample_text.txt is the file that gets compressed, compressed.txt is the compressed version, and decompressed.txt is where the decompressed version of compressed.txt goes
